# Bookstore-Management-System
The Bookstore Management System is a RESTful API built in Go that simplifies the management of a book collection. It offers essential CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionalities for books and is developed using Go as the backend language. The API is designed to be straightforward to use and integrate into other applications. It utilizes the Gorilla Mux router for routing HTTP requests and GORM for interacting with a MySQL database. Postman, a popular API testing tool, can be employed to interact with and test the API's endpoints efficiently.
